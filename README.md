# Pixel Buds Libre

An independent, open-source Android app to fully control the **Google Pixel Buds
Pro 2** without the official Pixel Buds app or Google Play Services.

> **Status:** reverse-engineering phase. There is no working app yet. See `TODO.md`
> for the current state.

## Why

The official Pixel Buds app requires Google Play Services. This project
reconstructs the BLE/RFCOMM communication protocol between the official app and
the Buds based on the maintainer's own, legally obtained Bluetooth captures and
APK analysis of software the maintainer has installed themselves — with the goal
of a free, privacy-friendly implementation that also works on GrapheneOS and other
Google-free Android variants.

## Project goal

Build an open, self-contained Android app that lets you fully manage the Pixel
Buds Pro 2 (ANC modes, EQ, touch controls, battery, case sounds, etc.) with no
dependency on the official Pixel Buds app or Google Play Services (GMS).

To get there, the communication protocol between the official Pixel Buds app and
the Pixel Buds Pro 2 first has to be reconstructed through Bluetooth traffic
analysis and reverse engineering of the Android APK. That knowledge is then used
to design, implement, test, and document a native Android app.

## Approach

1. **Capture** — record Bluetooth HCI snoop logs while triggering known actions
   in the official app and on the hardware (see
   [`CAPTURE_BLUETOOTH_HCI_SNOOP.md`](./CAPTURE_BLUETOOTH_HCI_SNOOP.md) and
   [`TESTPLAN_BLUETOOTH_HCI_SNOOP.md`](./TESTPLAN_BLUETOOTH_HCI_SNOOP.md)).
2. **Reverse engineer** — analyze the official Pixel Buds APK (JADX, apktool) to
   understand the internal Bluetooth logic and protocol implementation.
3. **Correlate** — match APK findings against capture data to reconstruct the
   `libmaestro` / `libgfps` wire protocol, documented in
   [`PROTOCOL_NOTES.md`](./PROTOCOL_NOTES.md) (working notes) and `PROTOCOL.md`
   (the resulting specification).
4. **Design & implement** — build a native Android app (Kotlin, Jetpack Compose,
   MVVM/Clean Architecture) around that protocol knowledge, targeting GrapheneOS
   as the primary reference OS with compatibility for stock AOSP-based ROMs. See
   [`ARCHITECTURE.md`](./ARCHITECTURE.md).
5. **Validate & document** — test against real hardware, document findings and
   decisions, and keep protocol/architecture knowledge versioned and evidence-based.

## Core principles

- **Zero-GMS:** the app must function 100% offline, with no telemetry, analytics,
  crash reporting, or `INTERNET` permission whatsoever.
- **GrapheneOS-first:** minimal permissions, no location permissions for BLE
  scanning, no continuous background scanning, and graceful handling of
  GrapheneOS's aggressive Bluetooth/battery policies.
- **Evidence-based reverse engineering:** every protocol claim is backed by a
  capture, a code reference, or an experiment, and is explicitly labeled as fact,
  assumption, or hypothesis — never silently guessed.
- **Clean-room implementation:** informed by the public reverse-engineering
  findings of [`qzed/pbpctrl`](https://github.com/qzed/pbpctrl) (Linux/Rust,
  MIT-licensed) for protocol *knowledge* only — no code is copied from that
  project, and no code from BlueZ/D-Bus/UPower is applicable, since this app
  talks directly to Android's native Bluetooth stack (Fluoride/Babel) instead.

## Target platform

- Compile/target SDK: API 34 (Android 14)
- Minimum supported Android API: **TBD** (see `ARCHITECTURE.md` §15)
- Primary reference OS: GrapheneOS, with compatibility maintained for stock
  AOSP-based ROMs

## Attribution

Protocol structure knowledge is informed by the public reverse-engineering work of
the [`qzed/pbpctrl`](https://github.com/qzed/pbpctrl) project (Linux/Rust). No
source code from that project is reused directly; only documented protocol/frame
knowledge informs this Android-native implementation.
